						<h2><a href="#">Ladan Vafi</a></h2>
						<p>Ladan gets to write her own bio, because Mark isn't going to make any assumptions on what Ladan would like to say about herself.</p>

						<h2><a href="#">Mark Duffin</a></h2>
						<p>Mark is a budding Scottish/Canadian developer, who enjoys making colourful, fun websites (that are usually green). He loves spending time with his family, watching football, and drinking too much coffee.</p>

				<h1>Site Map</h1>
				<div id="sitemapwrapper">
					<div>
						<p>Our review aims to make minimal changes to the way the map of the site works. The major change comes in the form of a login section that would contain information that we would not want to be public. In this case, the scope is minimized to only Quizzes and Downloads, but there is certainly the potential to expand this further.</p>

				<h1>Proposed Changes</h1>
				<p>Here is a list of changes we propose to the site, as well as the rationale behind these recommendations:</p>
				<div id="rationalewrapper">
					<div>
						<h2>Convert to HTML5</h2>
						<p>The extra semantics of HTML5 will increase Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and improve site accessibility.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h2>Convert to CSS3</h2>
						<p>CSS3 allows for more responsive code, without having to rely to heavily on plug-ins. This means better browser performance as the user does not need to download as many files to use the site.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h2>CSS Reset</h2>
						<p>Employing a CSS reset will ensure a cleaner site, regardless of the browser being used. Even if the more advanced CSS3 features are not supported, the basic layout will be clear and clean, meaning the site will still be informative and useful.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h2>Possible Future Developments</h2>
						<p>In the future, we would look to introduce the ability to support online quizzes, a page-specific sticky navigation to allow students to access areas of each page quicker, and minified files for even more enhanced browser performance.</p>
